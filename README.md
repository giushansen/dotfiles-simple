= Guillaume Dot Files

These config files offer a simple alternative to set up a system with bash.


== Installation

  Assumptions are made on using the gem bundle and having a Sites directory at the home user directory (Mac OSX).
  Just copy the files (not the Readme) in your home directory by prepending them with a '.'.

== Features

  You would be able to:

  * Have a colorful shell prompt
  * Have aliases such as "c project" instead of "cd ~/Sites/project"
  * A well managed bash history
  * Vim as default editor and Macvim as a gem editor when doing "bundle open whatever-gem"
